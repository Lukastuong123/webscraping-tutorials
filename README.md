# Tutorials for web scraping and crawling

This repository contains a basic tutorial for scraping and crawling websites using
Python. It also includes some examples of code that has been written to scrape other
websites.

# Set-up

You will need to have Python 3.5 installed. As a lab we are moving onto the new version of Python and the tutorials will not work with Python 2. You can download it [here] (https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can also download it via [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which will include many of the packages in the distribution.

You will also need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.  You should make a Github account if you haven’t already.

You can also consult our [wiki](https://github.com/socdyn/wiki/blob/master/vesta/get_started_with_python.md) for advice on setting this up:

When you have it installed please install the following packages using `pip3` (if you never installed Python2 then you might be able to just use `pip`). If you are using Anaconda then please try to install the packages
with `conda` first and if it doesn't work use `pip3`.

```
jupyter
beautifulsoup4
requests
selenium
pandas
json
```

You should make sure you have Jupyter notebooks running correctly, you can find information on running it [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html). You should be able to open a notebook in your browser by typing `jupyter notebooks` into the command line. From here you can then create a Python3 notebook by clicking the ‘New’ tab on the right and selecting ‘Python3’ or ‘IPython3’. You can then import all the packages into the notebook to check they were installed.
